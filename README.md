# time2code

This is a collection of daily (or not so daily) coding problems that I have done to practice my practical scripting knowledge.  

Through these problems, I have learned the following.  
1) Parsing through a file (such as logs) and generating a wanted output.  
2) Practice using dictionaries  
3) Regular Expressions  
4) So much more, in general these practice problems have made me a better coder.  



Feel free to use for your own practice and if you come up with better ways to do these problems, I'd love to hear it.  

This repo is going through constant updates as when I first started it, I didn't think much about documentation. So I will be going through each of these scripts to add meaningful documentation.
